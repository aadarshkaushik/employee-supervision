**Employee Supervision React + Spring Boot Project**

The Employee Supervision Project is a microservices-based application developed using Spring Boot to manage and monitor employee activities across various departments and organizations. The architecture includes several microservices, each responsible for distinct functionalities, such as employee management, department handling, and organization operations.

**Key components**:

1. **API Gateway****: Acts as an entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice.
2. **Config Server**: Manages centralized configuration for all the microservices, ensuring consistency and ease of management.
3. **Department Service**: Handles department-related data and operations, such as creation and modification of departments.
4. **Employee Service**: Manages employee data, including CRUD operations on employee profiles and their supervision status.
5. **Employee Supervision Service**: Focuses on tracking employee supervision across the organization.
6. **Organization Service**: Deals with organizational data, managing the overall structure of the company and its departments.
7. **Service Registry**: Uses Eureka for service discovery, enabling dynamic registration and discovery of microservices.
8. **Zipkin Server**: Facilitates distributed tracing to monitor the performance and latency of each service in real-time.
   
The project architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and efficient monitoring through microservices communication, centralized configuration, and service discovery. Additionally, Zipkin Server integration enables real-time tracing, ensuring performance monitoring and issue detection.
